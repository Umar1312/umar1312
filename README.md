# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Umar Salim, and welcome to my GitHub profile! 

## About Me

I'm a Software Engineer.

I'm incredibly passionate about software engineering, especially when it comes to challenging projects that allow me to push my limits and grow as a developer. I'm particularly interested in mobile development and have a deep love for creating beautiful, intuitive user interfaces. For me, there's nothing more satisfying than seeing a well-designed app come to life and knowing that users will enjoy using it. I'm constantly striving to learn new skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies so that I can deliver the best possible experience to users.

Here are some of the programming languages, tools, and frameworks I'm proficient in:

- Programming languages: Dart, JavaScript, Python, Java, SQL.
- Frameworks: Flutter, React Native, Android, iOS, React, NodeJS.
